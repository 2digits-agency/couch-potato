# Weather App

Weather app built with Expo CLI

## TODO

- Update @storybook/react-native & tailwindcss when possible
  - Replace gap styling with nativewind or expo support when possible: https://github.com/marklawlor/nativewind/issues/464
- Replace Header preferences with data from global state manager
- Move hardcoded text to translations
- Decide on how to tackle 'Functional components cannot be given refs'
- Remove unused dependencies
